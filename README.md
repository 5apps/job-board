Job Board
=========

This is very rough start, like so rough, if you rub your hands against it, it will feel like sand paper, so be warned.

The goal here is to create some sort of "job board" that pairs people in need of things with people who can do those things. So, my idea for a rough start is to create some schema and some structured data to facilitate this goal.

The place I am currently contract posts jobs in Markdown files [like this](https://github.com/ehealthafrica/jobs). I propose we do the same, as well as creating similar files for "people" instead of the [github issues](https://github.com/opensourcedesigners/job-board/issues/3) like some of you have started doing. My reasons for this are: using markdown files are way more flexible and can be used in lots of ways... like generating a static site with Jekyll or parsing in other ways.

# Current Projects

##Open listings

Feel free to post projects that need work immediately or in the near term. Please reference our [Design Brief]{https://github.com/opensourcedesign/Design-Brief} in order to correctly explain your project.

##O.S.D. Meta

Anything related to improving O.S.D. directly. Listed in order of attainability.

#### Identity & Logo
OSD  needs to craft an identity that is of the community and responds to the idea of open source in a clear, memorable way. Maybe that means the logo is something that is continuously iterated on, maybe it is something that has a consistent form that responds to changes in the greater community/world.

#### Project listing page
What projects are currently in need of completion? The current solution has been to post each project as a github issue, which might be a good solution in the short term. It might be better to have an ongoing list where designers can post and up-vote freely.

####A space on the web
http://opensourcedesign.net redirects to Github. Would it meaningfully help the community to make a site with digests of all the repos?
