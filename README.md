Job Board
=========

This is very rough start, like so rough, if you rub your hands against it, it will feel like sand paper, so be warned.

The goal here is to create some sort of "job board" that pairs people in need of things with people who can do those things. So, my idea for a rough start is to create some schema and some structured data to facilitate this goal.

The place I am currently contract posts jobs in Markdown files [like this](https://github.com/ehealthafrica/jobs). I propose we do the same, as well as creating similar files for "people" instead of the [github issues](https://github.com/opensourcedesigners/job-board/issues/3) like some of you have started doing. My reasons for this are: using markdown files are way more flexible and can be used in lots of ways... like generating a static site with Jekyll or parsing in other ways.
