Job Board
===

The goal here is to create a proper **"job board"** that pairs open source people and projects in need design work with designers who can do those tasks. It will be a mixture of *both gratis as well as paying work.* A job can be relatively small task to an entire project. I think the ideal balance would be a mixture of about:

* 25% small singular tasks
* 15% new or fork of an existing project
* 60% product / feature development on existing projects


*Note: this process is rough and a work in progress, please free to contribute ideas, approaches, and of course jobs :)*


### Submit a Job

Our job submission process is being done transparently and "in the open." If you work on an open source software project or community, feel free to submit a job to our job board by doing the following:

- Fork the repo
- Copy `job-template.md` into the `jobs` folder
- Name your compy something like `2015-03-sticker-design-for-lnug.md`
- Fill out the fields inside the template you just copied
- Submit a pull request
- Have a margarita

After those steps you will have submitted a job to the OSD job board ;)


### Why This Funky Approach?

The idea behind using markdown files for now is to create some structure & scehma around data that is collected. This will eventually be turned into a section on the [opensourcedesign.net](http://opensourcedesign.net) website that has a more user friendly webform for designers and people without command line knowledge or a Github account. 

However, we will probably always support the Markdown format of "posting" jobs as it caters to techies and has some sizable advantages. Using markdown files is very flexible and can be used in lots of ways. Using Git underneath provides a transparent and verifiable paper trail of who created or edited what. Using Github also provides a relatively easy permissions / access control which is both open & public as well as reliable.
